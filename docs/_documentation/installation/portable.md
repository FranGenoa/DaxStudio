The portable version of DAX Studio is distributed as a single zip file. 

To run the portable version you just need to unzip the zip file into a folder and double-click on the DaxStudio.exe file. 

When running the portable version any settings, logs and query history will be saved in subfolders under the folder holding DAX Studio so you can copy/paste this folder between machines or store it on a USB drive.

> *Note:* The Excel add-in is not available when using the portable install as the add-in needs to be installed in order to be registered with Excel.
